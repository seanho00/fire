"I came to cast fire on the earth,<br>
and would that it were already kindled! 

[50](# "ref")
I have a baptism to be baptized with,<br>
and how great is my distress<br>
until it is accomplished!

[Luke 12:49-59 (ESV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

******

[51](# "ref")
Do you think that I have come<br>
to give peace on earth?<br>
No, I tell you, but rather division.

[52](# "ref")
For from now on in one house<br>
there will be five divided,<br>
three against two and two against three.

[Luke 12:49-59 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

******

[53](# "ref")
They will be divided,<br>
father against son and son against father,

mother against daughter <br>
and daughter against mother,

mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law<br>
and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”

[Luke 12:49-59 (ESV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

He also said to the crowds,<br>
“When you see a cloud rising in the west,<br>
you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’<br>
And so it happens.

[55](# "ref")
And when you see the south wind blowing, <br>
you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ <br>
and it happens.

[Luke 12:49-59 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

******

[56](# "ref")
You hypocrites! You know how to interpret<br>
the appearance of earth and sky, <br>
but why do you not know <br>
how to interpret the present time?

[57](# "ref")
“And why do you not judge<br>
for yourselves what is right?

[Luke 12:49-59 (ESV) (p.5/6)](# "ref")

******

[58](# "ref")
As you go with your accuser <br>
before the magistrate,<br>
make an effort to settle with him on the way,<br>
lest he drag you to the judge,<br>
and the judge hand you over to the officer,<br>
and the officer put you in prison.

[59](# "ref")
I tell you, you will never get out<br>
until you have paid the very last penny."

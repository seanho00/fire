“And why do you not **judge**<br>
for yourselves what is **right**?

[Luke 12:56 (ESV)](# "ref")
[Helsinki, Finland. Thomas Drouault](https://unsplash.com/photos/IBUcu_9vXJc "caption")

>>>
+ why, **even** amongst yourselves
  + you do not **judge** that which is **right**?
+ two levels of **application**:
+ **horiz** / interpers
  + cf Mt5:25-26: hatred vs **reconciliation**
  + **prereq** for God's forgiveness
+ **vert** / against God:
  + believing we have a just **claim**
+ if you don't get this **right** even in
  + secular **business** relationships
+ how will you possibly **stand**
  + when **God** brings a claim against you?

As you go with your **accuser** <br>
before the **magistrate**,<br>
make an effort to **settle** with him on the way,

[Luke 12:58 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ accuser: **opponent** in justice
  + has a **claim** against me
  + according to **lawful** / right
  + v59 impl. I **owe** money
+ I think I can **win** in court
  + so **unwilling** to settle
+ settle: be reconciled, paid up to be **even**
  + make effort: do some **work**
+ no longer really about **justice**
  + but **vengeance**
  + **proving** opponent wrong
  + "I **win**, you **lose**"
+ but I do not **control** the courts:

I tell you, you will never get out<br>
until you have paid the very last **penny**."

[Luke 12:58-59 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ magistrate: ruler, **authority**
+ judge: decides **fault**, convicts, sentencing
+ officer: proctor, bailiff
  + **enforces** repayment of debt
+ I wanted to **punish** opponent
  + to **fullest** extent of law
+ but ends up **I** must pay
+ last penny: held to **strictest** std of law
+ how much greater **debt** do we **owe**
  + to the **holy** Author of life
+ Psalm 130:

O Lord, who could **stand**?

But with you there is **forgiveness**,<br>
that you may be **feared**.

+ **severity** of law vs
+ **kindness** of grace
+ e.g., exercising legal **rights** crossing border
  + "under **exemption**, I have a **right**!"
  + "right not to have car **searched**!" (no you don't)
  + e.g., feeding kid **oranges** in line
+ God has every **right** to remember our sins
+ it is His **forgiveness** that is
  + even **more** fearsome
+ we need to show the same **mercy** to others:

So **speak** and so **act** as those who are<br>

For judgment is **without mercy**<br>
to one who has **shown no mercy**.

Mercy **triumphs** over judgment!

[James 2:12-13 (ESV)](# "ref")
[Nancy, France. Rémi Walle](https://unsplash.com/photos/UOwvwZ9Dy6w "caption")

>>>
+ in our **pride** we believe
  + our legal **standing**
  + is **firmer** than it really is
+ the **law of liberty** is that
  + **no one** is righteous
  + apart from Christ's **gift** of life
+ let our **words** and **actions** reflect
  + we are the **forgiven**
+ **mercy** is more worthy to pursue
  + than **judgment**

His **winnowing fork** is in his hand,<br>
and he will clear his threshing floor

and gather his **wheat** into the barn,<br>
but the **chaff** he will burn <br>
with **unquenchable fire**.
